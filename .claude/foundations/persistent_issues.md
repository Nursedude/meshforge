## Development Checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] No `Path.home()` — use `get_real_user_home()`
- [ ] Actionable error messages, appropriate log levels
- [ ] Services verified with `check_service()` before use
- [ ] `subprocess` calls have `timeout=` (MF004)
- [ ] Utilities from central location, not duplicated
- [ ] `safe_import` for external deps only; direct imports for first-party

---

## Quick Reference: Import Patterns

```python
# Paths
from utils.paths import get_real_user_home, get_real_username, MeshForgePaths, ReticulumPaths

# Settings / Logging
from utils.common import SettingsManager, CONFIG_DIR
from utils.logging_config import get_logger

# Service checks
from utils.service_check import check_service, check_port, ServiceState

# External deps (safe_import)
from utils.safe_import import safe_import
RNS, _HAS_RNS = safe_import('RNS')
_pub, _HAS_PUBSUB = safe_import('pubsub', 'pub')

# First-party — ALWAYS direct import
from utils.service_check import check_service
from utils.event_bus import emit_message
from gateway.rns_bridge import RNSMeshtasticBridge
```

**Test patching**: Patch `_HAS_*` flags directly, not `sys.modules`:
```python
@patch('gateway.rns_bridge._HAS_RNS', True)  # CORRECT
def test_rns(self): ...
```

---

## Issue #3: Services Not Started/Verified — MOSTLY RESOLVED

**Rule**: Always call `check_service()` before connecting to services.

- **Advisory** (daemons): Warn + continue — service may run outside systemd
- **Blocking** (TUI actions): Show error + fix hint, don't proceed

**Note**: Gateway checks are ADVISORY. Blocking checks caused "waiting for delivery"
regression when mosquitto wasn't detectable via systemctl.

**Remaining** (acceptable): `system_tools_mixin.py` and `service_menu_mixin.py` use
`systemctl status` for display only, not state decisions.

| Service | Port | systemd name |
|---------|------|--------------|
| meshtasticd | 4403 | meshtasticd |
| rnsd | None | rnsd |
| hamclock | 8080 | hamclock |
| mosquitto | 1883 | mosquitto |

---

## Issue #4: Silent Debug-Level Logging

Use appropriate log levels — don't hide errors at DEBUG:
- **ERROR**: Something broke | **WARNING**: Unusual | **INFO**: User-visible ops | **DEBUG**: Dev internals

---

## Issue #6: Large Files — ALL UNDER THRESHOLD

Only `knowledge_content.py` (1,993 lines) exceeds 1,500 — acceptable as content file.
Monitor files approaching 1,400 lines. Split proactively at 1,000 lines when adding features.

Top files: `meshtastic_protobuf_client.py` (1,433), `service_check.py` (1,410),
`map_http_handler.py` (1,404), `prometheus_exporter.py` (1,399).

---

## Issue #12: RNS "Address Already in Use"

**Rule**: Never call `RNS.Reticulum()` without `configdir=` when rnsd is running.

MeshForge creates a client-only config in `/tmp/meshforge_rns_client/` with
`share_instance = Yes` and no interface definitions, allowing connection to
rnsd without binding ports.

Location: `src/gateway/node_tracker.py` — `_init_rns_main_thread()`

---

## Issue #16: Gateway Message Routing Reliability

Delivery is **best-effort** — inherent to mesh networking. Message queue persists to SQLite for retry.
Always show "Sent (delivery not guaranteed)" or "Queued" status.

Files: `commands/messaging.py`, `gateway/rns_bridge.py`, `gateway/message_queue.py`

---

## Issue #17: Meshtastic Connection Contention (Single-Client TCP)

**meshtasticd only supports ONE TCP client at a time.** Multiple components creating
independent connections causes thrashing every 1-2 seconds.

### Fix: Shared Connection Manager
All components share ONE persistent connection via `get_connection_manager()`.
Short-lived reads use `MeshtasticConnection` context manager.
Long-lived connections acquire `MESHTASTIC_CONNECTION_LOCK`.

### HTTP fromradio Contention Fix
The `/api/v1/fromradio` endpoint is also single-consumer. `send_text_direct()` POSTs
directly to `/api/v1/toradio` without ever reading fromradio. All TX paths use this.

### Prevention
- **NEVER** create `TCPInterface()` directly — use connection manager
- **NEVER** read `/api/v1/fromradio` in TX paths — use `send_text_direct()`
- Reserve session-based `connect()` + `start_polling()` for config reads only

---

## Issue #18: Auto-Reconnect on Connection Drop

Gateway uses health monitoring + exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max)
in `rns_bridge.py`. All persistent connections should have health monitoring.
Release connection manager resources on disconnect.

---

## Issue #19: RNS Node Discovery from path_table

Use `RNS.Transport.path_table` (not just `destinations`) for complete routing info.
**path_table may be empty immediately after connect** — use delayed checks (5s) and
periodic re-checks (30s).

Location: `src/gateway/node_tracker.py`

---

## Issue #20: Service Detection & Status Display — ALL DONE

All 3 components resolved:

1. **Service Detection**: Simplified to systemctl-only for systemd services (SSOT)
2. **Status Display**: Separates "service state" from "detection capability" —
   never shows "FAILED" when service is running
3. **RX Messages**: `event_bus.py` → `websocket_server.py` → TUI live feed

### RNS Socket Detection
RNS uses abstract Unix domain sockets (`\0rns/{instance_name}`), not UDP port 37428.
Use `check_rns_shared_instance()` (3-tier: Unix socket → TCP → UDP fallback).

### Prevention
- UI must always distinguish "service state" from "detection capability"
- Use `check_rns_shared_instance()` for all rnsd checks (never raw UDP)

---

## Issue #21: Meshtastic CLI Preset Bug (Upstream)

**Not a MeshForge bug.** The Python meshtastic CLI doesn't always apply modem preset
changes correctly. Always verify in browser at `http://localhost:9443` after CLI changes.
Consider direct meshtasticd API calls instead of CLI.

---

## Issue #22: Never Overwrite meshtasticd's config.yaml

**Rule**: Check for existing valid config before touching it.

```
/etc/meshtasticd/
├── config.yaml     # PROVIDED BY meshtasticd — DO NOT OVERWRITE
├── available.d/    # HAT templates — PROVIDED BY meshtasticd — DO NOT CREATE
└── config.d/       # User's active HAT config — COPY from available.d/
```

Radio parameters (Bandwidth, SpreadFactor, TXpower) are set via
`meshtastic --set lora.modem_preset` and stored internally — **NEVER in yaml files**.

MeshForge's job: Help users SELECT HATs from meshtasticd's `available.d/`, COPY to
`config.d/`. Never overwrite `config.yaml` if it has a `Webserver:` section.

---

## Issue #23: Post-Install Verification

**Rule**: Never mark install "complete" until verification passes.

`scripts/verify_post_install.sh` checks: meshtasticd binary, config.yaml validity,
Webserver section, port 9443, radio detection, config.d/, rnsd, udev rules.
Also available via `meshforge --verify-install`.

---

## Issue #24: Python Environment Mismatch (rnsd + meshtastic module)

rnsd's `Meshtastic_Interface.py` plugin requires the `meshtastic` Python module.
pipx isolation, different Python versions, or user vs system site-packages can
make the module invisible to rnsd.

**Fix**: `sudo pip3 install --break-system-packages --ignore-installed meshtastic`
or install to the same Python that rnsd uses:
`head -1 $(which rnsd)` then use that interpreter's pip.

**Diagnose**: `sudo python3 -c "import meshtastic; print(meshtastic.__version__)"`

---

## Issue #27: rnsd is OPTIONAL

MeshForge supports two independent transports:
- **MQTT** (mosquitto) — Meshtastic native. Used for preset bridging, monitoring.
- **RNS** (rnsd) — Reticulum. Used for LXMF messaging, cross-protocol bridging.

**Meshtastic preset bridging** (LF ↔ ST) needs only mosquitto — both radios MQTT
uplink/downlink to the same broker with same channel/PSK. No gateway code needed.

**Full NOC** (Meshtastic + RNS) uses both transports. They coexist independently.

---

## Issue #29: Regression Prevention System — ACTIVE

100+ hours of circular regressions led to this 4-layer prevention system.

### Layer 1: Lint Rules (`scripts/lint.py`)
| Rule | Catches |
|------|---------|
| MF007 | Direct `TCPInterface()` outside connection infrastructure |
| MF008 | Raw `systemctl` for service state (use `service_check`) |
| MF009 | `RNS.Reticulum()` without `configdir=` |
| MF010 | `time.sleep()` in daemon loops |

### Layer 2: Regression Guard Tests (`tests/test_regression_guards.py`)
- `TestTCPConnectionContract` — No new direct TCPInterface
- `TestFromradioContract` — TX uses `send_text_direct()`
- `TestServiceCheckContract` — Service state via `check_service()` only
- `TestPathHomeContract` — No `Path.home()` violations
- `TestNoShellTrue` — No `shell=True` in subprocess
- `TestKnownServicesConsistency` — KNOWN_SERVICES stays correct

### Layer 3: Pre-Commit Hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`)
Setup: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

### Working With This System

**New file needs meshtasticd TCP:**
```python
# Short-lived:
from utils.connection_manager import MeshtasticConnection
with MeshtasticConnection() as conn:
    if conn: nodes = conn.nodes

# Long-lived:
from utils.meshtastic_connection import MESHTASTIC_CONNECTION_LOCK, wait_for_cooldown
if MESHTASTIC_CONNECTION_LOCK.acquire(timeout=10):
    wait_for_cooldown()
    interface = TCPInterface(hostname='localhost')
```

**Adding legitimate TCPInterface creation:**
1. Add to `ALLOWLISTED` in `TestTCPConnectionContract`
2. Add to `lock_aware_files` in lint.py MF007
3. Acquire `MESHTASTIC_CONNECTION_LOCK` before creating

## Issue #30: NomadNet RPC ConnectionRefusedError (2026-03-11)

NomadNet crashes on startup when `get_interface_stats()` can't connect to rnsd's RPC socket.

**Root causes**: RNS version mismatch (pipx venv vs system rnsd), user mismatch
(root rnsd vs user NomadNet), rnsd still initializing, or stale state.

**Fix**: Pre-launch check in `_nomadnet_rns_checks.py` uses NomadNet's own Python
interpreter to test RPC (not system rnstatus). Detects version mismatches and
suggests `pipx upgrade nomadnet`. Auto-restarts rnsd if needed.

Post-failure diagnosis in `nomadnet.py:_diagnose_nomadnet_error` detects
`ConnectionRefusedError` / `Errno 111` patterns in NomadNet logfile.

---

## Issue #31: No Silent Persistent System Changes on Startup (2026-03-12)

**Rule**: NEVER make persistent system changes silently on startup.

MeshForge's `auto_lock_port()` was silently adding iptables REJECT rules on port 9443
every TUI launch, persisting after exit. This broke the Meshtastic web UI.

**Prohibited on startup**: iptables rules, cron jobs, udev rules, systemd unit mods,
config file overwrites (see also Issue #22).

MeshForge **observes and assists** — it does not take over infrastructure.
Explicit user actions (e.g., service_menu lock/unlock) are acceptable.

**Cleanup for affected users**: `sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 9443 ! -s 127.0.0.1 -j REJECT`

---

## Issue #32: NomadNet "Enabled but Disconnected" Interfaces (2026-03-13)

**Symptoms**: NomadNet shows interfaces as "enabled" but disconnected with no RX/TX.
MeshForge status says "rnsd: RUNNING (shared instance available)" when rnsd is actually dead.

**Root causes** (3 bugs):

1. **pgrep false positive**: `check_process_running('rnsd')` fallback used `pgrep -f 'python.*rnsd'`
   which matched any process mentioning "rnsd" (shell invocations, test runners, editors).

2. **Blind status display**: NomadNet status printed "(shared instance available)" without calling
   `check_rns_shared_instance()` — it assumed shared instance from process detection alone.

3. **No diagnostics when down**: Interface health checks (rnstatus, blocking interfaces) only
   ran when rnsd was detected as "running". When detection was wrong or rnsd was genuinely
   down, user got zero actionable diagnostic info.

**Fixes** (2026-03-13):

- `_port_detection.py`: Tightened pgrep regex, added `/proc/{pid}/cmdline` verification
  via `_verify_process_cmdline()` to eliminate self-matches. Same fix for `check_process_with_pid()`.
- `nomadnet.py`: Status display now calls `get_rns_shared_instance_info()` to verify shared
  instance. Shows three states: verified connected (with method), running but no shared instance,
  or not running (with systemd fix hint). Blocking interface diagnostics now shown even when
  rnsd is down.

**Prevention**:
- `check_process_running()` now verifies all pgrep hits via `/proc/cmdline`
- Status display always distinguishes process detection from shared instance availability
- `find_blocking_interfaces()` runs regardless of rnsd state for pre-startup diagnostics

## Issue #33: Gateway Bridge Field Validation — First Green End-to-End (2026-04-18)

**Status**: RX path (Meshtastic→NomadNet) validated end-to-end for the first time on hardware.
Remaining: field TX validation with a second Meshtastic radio on the `meshforge` channel.

**Environment**:
- HAT: US / SHORT_TURBO / channel_num=8 (already correct at start; Phase 1 was no-op)
- RNode: Silicon Labs CP2102 on `/dev/ttyUSB0` → added as `[[RNode LoRa]]` in `/etc/reticulum/config`
- rnsd runs as root; NomadNet runs as `wh6gxz` via pipx venv — `--rnsconfig /etc/reticulum` keeps them aligned
- NomadNet LXMF delivery hash: `d69f7e802960b39561768588fc6e6082` (matched pre-configured `default_lxmf_destination`)
- Gateway LXMF source hash: `f68c2f56cb61527b6c9ad603b9a5009a` (from `~/.config/meshforge/gateway_identity`)

**Non-obvious gotchas** (recurring footguns — worth surfacing in install path):

1. **LXMF is NOT installed with RNS**. `pip install rns` does not pull `lxmf`. The gateway's
   `_rns_bridge_connection.py` logs `"RNS/LXMF library not installed - bridge cannot connect"`
   and continues with RNS subsystem marked `disabled`. Fix:
   ```
   pip3 install --user --break-system-packages lxmf
   ```
   The NomadNet pipx venv has its own LXMF but it is not on the system Python path.

2. **MQTT uplink/downlink default off**. Fresh Meshtastic devices ship with `uplinkEnabled=false`
   on all channels. Gateway `mqtt_bridge` mode receives NOTHING until at least one channel has
   uplink enabled. Preferred pattern: dedicated bridge channel (named `meshforge` in our config)
   with its own PSK, leave primary channel untouched for local mesh privacy:
   ```
   meshtastic --ch-index 2 --ch-set uplink_enabled true --ch-set downlink_enabled true
   ```

3. **gateway.json `mqtt_channel` must match channel NAME, not preset name.** The gateway
   subscribes to `msh/{REGION}/2/json/{CHANNEL_NAME}/#`. Default config ships with `"LongFast"`.
   Update both `meshtastic.mqtt_channel` and `mqtt_bridge.channel` to the actual channel name.

4. **Local HAT TX uplink to MQTT depends on firmware**. ~~Only RX from other nodes is uplinked.~~
   **UPDATED 2026-04-20 (moc3, meshtasticd 2.7.15)**: the local HAT's own TX *does* uplink when
   `mqtt.enabled=true`, `mqtt.json_enabled=true`, and the sending channel has `uplinkEnabled=true`.
   A send of `meshtastic --host localhost --sendtext 'probe' --ch-index 2 --dest '!ffffffff'`
   appears on `msh/US/2/json/meshforge/{local_node_id}` within ~1s and is bridged to NomadNet
   end-to-end (confirmed by `Message bridged` gateway log + conversation file under
   `~/.nomadnetwork/storage/conversations/<gateway_hash>/`). Older firmware may suppress local TX —
   if you hit a silent bridge on an older fleet box, upgrade meshtasticd before blaming the gateway.
   To exercise the RX path without a HAT at all (synthetic probe):
   ```
   mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t 'msh/US/2/json/meshforge/!deadbeef' \
     -m '{"payload":{"text":"test"},"sender":"!deadbeef","type":"text","channel":2,"to":4294967295,"from":3735928559}'
   ```

5. **traffic.log permission noise**. `monitoring/traffic_storage.py` tries to write to
   `~/.cache/meshforge/logs/traffic.log`; fails with `Errno 13` when the dir doesn't exist or
   is root-owned. Non-fatal, gateway still bridges — but noisy. Create dir at install time or
   handle `FileNotFoundError` by creating parents.

**Regression guards** (all 15 pass as of 2026-04-18):
- `tests/test_regression_guards.py` — TCP/MQTT/service-check/PathHome/shell/event-bus contracts
- `python3 scripts/lint.py --all` — MF001-010 clean

**Rollback**: `/etc/reticulum/config.bak.20260418-074417` preserves pre-change state.

## Issue #34: mqtt_bridge topic shape mismatch (2026-04-18)

**Symptom**: `bridge_mode=mqtt_bridge` gateway reports "MQTT bridge handler connected"
but never receives any real mesh traffic from local meshtasticd. Gateway appears green
in logs; actual RX count stays at zero. Meanwhile `bridge_mode=message_bridge` is the
only mode that delivers messages — at the cost of holding :4403 forever and starving
the :9443 web UI.

**Root cause**: `mqtt_bridge_handler._on_connect` subscribed to
`{root}/{REGION}/2/json/{channel}/#`, but meshtasticd 2.7.x publishes to
`{root}/2/json/{channel}/{node}` — no region segment. MQTT `+` is single-segment,
so one subscription pattern can't match both shapes.

**How it slipped through Issue #33's validation**: the "first green end-to-end"
on moc1 was validated with a crafted `mosquitto_pub -t 'msh/US/2/json/meshforge/...'`
that happened to match the region-ful pattern. Nobody ever observed meshtasticd's
real publishes go through the bridge.

**Fix** (`be6f411`):
- `_on_connect` now subscribes to both shapes for JSON and protobuf:
  `{root}/+/2/json/{channel}/#` and `{root}/2/json/{channel}/#`
- TX publish path omits the region segment when `mqtt_bridge.region == ""` to match
  what meshtasticd subscribes to for downlink.
- `MQTTBridgeConfig.region` default changed from `"US"` to `""`. Explicit `"US"` or
  similar stays valid for daemon builds that DO include region in the topic path.

**Validation** on volcanoai (meshtasticd 2.7.15):
```
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -u mesh_publish -P <pass> \
  -t 'msh/2/json/meshforge/!deadbeef' \
  -m '{"payload":{"text":"…"},"sender":"!deadbeef","type":"text","channel":3,"to":4294967295,"from":3735928559,"id":9999001}'
```
→ gateway logs `node_tracker | Added new node: !deadbeef` and
`gateway.cli | Message bridged: meshtastic -> !ffffffff`. :9443 stays healthy (200),
:4403 has no persistent TCP client.

**Fleet state post-fix** (2026-04-18):
- volcanoai, moc3: `bridge_mode=mqtt_bridge`, `region=""`, restarted, subscribed to both shapes
- moc, moc1, moc2: no `gateway.json` exists — picked up code change, ready for first config
- Backups preserved as `gateway.json.bak.20260418-*`

**Prevention**:
- Future MQTT-bridge validation must use real meshtasticd publishes, not crafted
  `mosquitto_pub` commands that assume a topic shape.
- When adding MQTT topic logic, default to subscribing to every plausible shape
  rather than one "correct" one — MQTT wildcards can't match structurally different paths.

## Issue #35: Gateway-delivered LXMF lands under GATEWAY's hash, not receiver's (2026-04-20)

**Symptom**: operator sends from local Meshtastic HAT on channel `meshforge`, gateway logs
`Message bridged: meshtastic -> !ffffffff` and `LXMF delivery confirmed`, but NomadNet appears
not to show the message. Classic "I sent it, where did it go?"

**Root cause (not a bug)**: the receiving NomadNet indexes the conversation by the LXMF
**sender** identity — which is the **gateway's own** source hash (`f68c2f56…` on moc3) —
NOT by the `default_lxmf_destination` (which is the RECEIVING NomadNet's own hash) or by the
original Meshtastic node id. Operators looking for a new "inbox" under their own identity, or a
new conversation per-Meshtastic-node, will not find one.

**Verification recipe**:
```
ls -lt ~/.nomadnetwork/storage/conversations/<gateway_lxmf_source_hash>/ | head
```
The newest file's mtime should match the send time. Content check:
```
strings -n 6 <that_file> | grep -E '^\[Mesh:'
```
Look for `[Mesh:<last-4-of-sender-nodeid>] <your text>`.

**Operator guidance**: open the conversation indexed by the GATEWAY's hash in NomadNet.
The text body is prefixed with `[Mesh:xxxx]` where `xxxx` is the last 4 hex chars of the
originating Meshtastic node id. All bridged traffic for a given gateway aggregates into that
single conversation — one-to-many from the NomadNet user's perspective.

**Prevention**: the TUI now has a **Delivery Audit** entry under the Gateway Bridge menu that
lists recent `Message bridged` / `LXMF delivery confirmed` log lines along with the gateway's
LXMF source hash and the NomadNet conversation path, so operators can navigate to the right
thread without filesystem spelunking. See `src/launcher_tui/handlers/gateway.py` → `_show_delivery_audit`.

## Issue #36: Meshtastic_Interface rnsd plugin — present, disabled, bypasses MeshForge (2026-04-20)

**State on moc3**: `/etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py.disabled` exists. The
config stanza `[[Meshtastic Gateway]]` is present in `/etc/reticulum/config` but points at a
file rnsd won't load (`.disabled` suffix). Template source:
`/opt/meshforge/templates/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py`.

**What it does (if enabled)**: holds a persistent TCP client on meshtasticd `:4403`, subscribes
to `meshtastic.receive` pubsub, and forwards packets with `decoded.portnum == RETICULUM_TUNNEL_APP`
only — plain Meshtastic text is ignored. Outbound sends fragment at 200B and `sendData(portNum=
RETICULUM_TUNNEL_APP, ...)`. It is effectively a native RNS-over-Meshtastic transport, not a text
bridge.

**What enabling it would LOSE vs. the MeshForge gateway**:
- `gateway/message_routing.py` rules (direction, source/dest/message regex filters)
- `~/.cache/meshforge/logs/gateway.log` audit trail and delivery stats
- `gateway/message_queue.py` persistent retry queue
- LXMF source identity aggregation under `f68c2f56…`
- Support for plain Meshtastic text at all

**Coexistence with current gateway** (`mqtt_bridge` mode): NO port conflict — the gateway uses
MQTT for RX and HTTP `/api/v1/toradio` for TX, never holding `:4403`. The plugin could be
enabled alongside without fighting for the TCP slot. It would only trigger for inbound packets
carrying the RNS tunnel portnum.

**Decision (2026-04-20): keep disabled.** No current use case needs RNS-tunneled Meshtastic
traffic, and the existing bridge handles text end-to-end. If a future use case appears (e.g.
native RNS nodes talking to remote RNS peers over LoRa without any MQTT broker present), enable
with:
```
sudo mv /etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py.disabled \
        /etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py
sudo systemctl restart rnsd
sudo journalctl -u rnsd -n 50   # expect "Meshtastic: Opening tcp device..."
```
Requires `python3 -c 'import meshtastic'` to succeed from rnsd's interpreter (Issue #24) —
already satisfied on moc3 (`/usr/bin/python3` + system-wide meshtastic 2.7.8).

**Prevention**: do not re-enable casually. The gateway owns the text-bridging contract;
this plugin is complementary infrastructure, not a replacement.

## Issue #37: NomadNet AuthenticationError on startup — rnsd rpc_key mismatch (2026-04-20)

**Symptom**: NomadNet crashes on startup with a Python traceback ending in:
```
File ".../RNS/Reticulum.py", line 1094, in get_rpc_client
    return multiprocessing.connection.Client(
        self.rpc_addr, family=self.rpc_type, authkey=self.rpc_key)
File ".../multiprocessing/connection.py", line 964, in answer_challenge
    raise AuthenticationError('digest sent was rejected')
```
Observed on moc1 and moc2 with fresh NomadNet installs. Repeating at every launch attempt.

**Root cause**: RNS shared-instance RPC uses `multiprocessing.connection.Client` with an
authkey derived from the RNS config that NomadNet loaded. If the **rnsd daemon** currently
listening on `@rns/default` was started with a DIFFERENT config dir (or a config that has
since been regenerated), its authkey differs and it rejects the client's digest.

Common triggers:
1. rnsd was started before `/etc/reticulum/config` existed (systemd auto-start on first
   boot), so it generated a key from `~/.reticulum/config` which has since been replaced.
2. `/etc/reticulum/config` was regenerated/edited after rnsd already loaded an older
   version — rnsd is still running with the old key.
3. A stale rnsd process from a prior install is still bound to `@rns/default` while a
   newer rnsd's config is what we expect to see.
4. Two users on the same box each have their own `~/.reticulum/config` and whichever
   rnsd won the race owns the abstract socket; the loser's config diverges.

**Not the cause on this fleet**: missing `--rnsconfig` flag. MeshForge's TUI launcher
always passes `--rnsconfig /etc/reticulum` via `_get_rns_config_for_user()`
(`src/launcher_tui/handlers/nomadnet.py:188`). The flag is unconditionally present.

**Wrapper patch (shipped in version 6)**: `nomadnet_wrapper.py` now catches
`multiprocessing.context.AuthenticationError` in `_safe_get_interface_stats`. NomadNet
starts without interface stats instead of crashing. See
`src/launcher_tui/handlers/_nomadnet_install_utils.py:_WRAPPER_VERSION` to force
re-creation on each fleet box. The wrapper is regenerated on every NomadNet launch via
TUI if the version marker changed.

**Diagnostic checklist** when AuthenticationError reappears on a box:
1. `ps -ef | grep rnsd` — note PID, config flag (`-c` or absence), start time. If
   rnsd is older than `/etc/reticulum/config`, it loaded a pre-edit key.
2. `sudo systemctl status rnsd` — confirm it's the systemd-managed one, not a
   leftover. Start time here vs. file mtime of `/etc/reticulum/config` is the tell.
3. `grep -r rpc_key /etc/reticulum ~/.reticulum 2>/dev/null` — any explicit
   `shared_instance_rpc_key` entries? If present and different, that's the proof.
4. `ls -la /home/*/.reticulum/config 2>/dev/null` — are there competing per-user
   configs any fleet script might race with?
5. `lsof 2>/dev/null | grep '@rns/default'` — identify which PID currently owns the
   abstract socket.

**Real fix** (manual, per-box): `sudo systemctl restart rnsd` **after** `/etc/reticulum/config`
is in its final state. That forces rnsd to re-derive the key from the current config, aligning
with what NomadNet loads on next start.

**Prevention**: MeshForge install paths should order "write /etc/reticulum/config" BEFORE
"start rnsd" (not the reverse). If the Issue #37 wrapper patch masks the crash, a follow-up
preflight check should explicitly probe the RPC socket and warn the operator — that's
future work, not part of this ship.
