## Issue #25: rnsd PermissionError on /etc/reticulum/storage/ratchets

### Symptom
rnsd crashes in a background thread with:
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/reticulum/storage/ratchets'
```
Additionally, `/etc/reticulum/identity` is never created, and the TUI "Show local identity" shows "No identity provided, cannot continue."

### Root Cause
RNS added **key ratcheting** support which requires a `ratchets/` subdirectory under storage. `Identity.persist_job()` runs in a background thread and calls `os.makedirs(ratchetdir)`. The install script didn't create this directory, and `ReticulumPaths.ensure_system_dirs()` was defined but never called at runtime.

### Fix (v0.5.x, 2026-02-09)
**Self-healing at runtime** — MeshForge now creates the directories automatically:
1. `startup_checks.check_all()` calls `ensure_system_dirs()` at TUI launch
2. `rns_bridge._init_rns_main_thread()` calls it before RNS init
3. `install_noc.sh` creates `storage/ratchets/` during install
4. `check_rns_storage_permissions()` diagnostic detects the issue
5. After fixing dirs, MeshForge auto-restarts rnsd via `apply_config_and_restart()`

### Files
- `src/utils/paths.py` — `ETC_RATCHETS`, `ensure_system_dirs()`
- `src/gateway/rns_bridge.py` — Self-heal in `_init_rns_main_thread()`
- `src/launcher_tui/startup_checks.py` — Self-heal in `check_all()`
- `src/core/diagnostics/checks/rns.py` — `check_rns_storage_permissions()`
- `scripts/install_noc.sh` — Pre-create dirs
- `src/launcher_tui/rns_menu_mixin.py` — Fixed `rnid` invocation

### Status: RESOLVED

## Issue #26: ReticulumPaths Fallback Copies Cause Config Divergence

### Symptom
`.reticulum` interface configuration is "lost" between sessions. RNS config changes made in the TUI have no effect. rnsd uses a different config file than what MeshForge reads/writes.

### Root Cause
**Four separate copies** of `ReticulumPaths` existed in the codebase:
1. `src/utils/paths.py` — **Canonical** (correct: checks `/etc/reticulum`, XDG, `~/.reticulum`)
2. `src/launcher_tui/main.py` — Fallback (missing `get_interfaces_dir`, `ensure_system_dirs`)
3. `src/launcher_tui/rns_menu_mixin.py` — Fallback (missing `ensure_system_dirs`)
4. `src/core/diagnostics/checks/rns.py` — Fallback (**WRONG: skipped `/etc/reticulum` and XDG entirely**)
5. `src/gateway/rns_bridge.py` — Fallback (missing `get_interfaces_dir`, `ensure_system_dirs`)

### Fix (v0.5.x, 2026-02-09)
**Eliminated all fallback copies.** Every file now imports directly:
```python
# NO try/except, NO fallback class
from utils.paths import ReticulumPaths
```

### Prevention
- **NEVER** duplicate `ReticulumPaths`. Always import from `utils/paths.py`.
- `utils/paths.py` is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all path resolution.

### Status: RESOLVED

## Issue #28: API Proxy Steals fromradio Packets from Native Web Client

**Date Identified**: 2026-02-10
**Severity**: Critical (breaks meshtasticd web client at :9443)

### Symptom
When MeshForge is running, the Meshtastic web client at `ip:9443` shows
no data. The gateway bridge works fine (RX green), NomadNet talks to other
RNS nodes normally. Only the native web client is broken.

### Root Cause
`MeshtasticApiProxy` was **enabled by default**. It continuously polls
`GET /api/v1/fromradio` from meshtasticd's HTTP API on port 9443.
This endpoint is **queue-based** — each GET pops the next protobuf packet.
MeshForge drained the queue before the native web client could read it.

### Fix Applied
1. **Default `enable_api_proxy` to `False`** in `MapServer.__init__`
2. **Added `--enable-api-proxy` CLI flag** for explicit opt-in
3. **`/mesh/` redirects to native `:9443`** when proxy is disabled

### Prevention
Never enable the API proxy by default. The gateway (TCP:4403) and
web client (HTTP:9443) are separate channels and should coexist.

### Status: RESOLVED

## Health Check Reconciliation (2026-02-20) — Moved from persistent_issues.md

The code review health check (2026-01-24) identified 5 critical (C1-C5) and 1 high (H1)
issues. All resolved:

| ID | Issue | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|----------|
| C1 | LXMF Source None after partial RNS init | **MITIGATED** | Guard at `rns_bridge.py:579-580` |
| C2 | reconnect.py raises None on early interruption | **FIXED** | `reconnect.py:176-178` |
| C3 | Unbounded node tracking dicts (memory leak) | **FIXED** | MAX_NODES caps + eviction |
| C4 | Stats dict race conditions (24 racy increments) | **FIXED** | threading.Lock added |
| C5 | Atomic write uses deterministic temp path | **FIXED** | `tempfile.mkstemp()` |
| H1 | Non-interruptible shutdown in daemon loops | **FIXED** | `_stop_event.wait()` everywhere |

## Issue #1: Path.home() Returns /root with sudo — RESOLVED (2026-02-20)

Zero `Path.home()` violations remain. Use `get_real_user_home()` from `utils/paths.py`.
Fixed last 3 violations in `mqtt_bridge_handler.py`, `cli.py`, `rns_config.py`.
Linter (`scripts/lint.py`) checks MF001. Regression test in `test_regression_guards.py`.

---

## Issue #5: Duplicate Utility Functions — RESOLVED (2026-02-20)

All 20 `safe_import` fallback copies consolidated to direct imports (-220 lines).
Rule: `safe_import` is for EXTERNAL deps only. First-party modules always use direct imports.
Follow-up: `startup_checks.py` converted from `safe_import('utils.service_check')` to direct import.

---

## Issue #7: Missing File References — RESOLVED

Create scripts before referencing them in menu options. Use commands layer when possible.

---

## Issue #8: Outdated Fallback Versions — RESOLVED

Search for hardcoded version strings when bumping: `grep -rn "0\.[0-9]\.[0-9]" src/*.py`

---

## Issue #9: Broad Exception Swallowing — MOSTLY RESOLVED (2026-02-20)

28/30 fixed across 7 files (tcp_monitor, system_diagnostics, setup_wizard, hardware_config,
rns_sniffer, site_planner). 2 benign by design (packet_dissectors, pskreporter_subscriber).

---

## Issue #10: Map Control Panel Scrollbar Overlap — FIXED (2026-02-25)

Added thin dark-themed scrollbar CSS to `web/node_map.html`.

---

## Handler Registry Migration — COMPLETE (2026-02-28)

49-mixin inheritance chain replaced with handler registry pattern.
See `handler_protocol.py` (Protocol + BaseHandler + TUIContext) and
`handler_registry.py` (register/lookup/dispatch). 60 handler files in
`launcher_tui/handlers/`. `main.py` dropped from 1,947 to 1,148 lines.


---

## Issue #17: Meshtastic Connection Contention (Single-Client TCP) — RESOLVED (2026-04-21 archived)

**meshtasticd only supports ONE TCP client at a time.** Multiple components creating
independent connections causes thrashing every 1-2 seconds.

### Fix: Shared Connection Manager
All components share ONE persistent connection via `get_connection_manager()`.
Short-lived reads use `MeshtasticConnection` context manager.
Long-lived connections acquire `MESHTASTIC_CONNECTION_LOCK`.

### HTTP fromradio Contention Fix
The `/api/v1/fromradio` endpoint is also single-consumer. `send_text_direct()` POSTs
directly to `/api/v1/toradio` without ever reading fromradio. All TX paths use this.

### Prevention (automated)
- Lint `MF007` — no direct `TCPInterface()` outside connection infrastructure.
- `TestTCPConnectionContract` — regression guard against new violations.
- `TestFromradioContract` — TX must use `send_text_direct()`.


---

## Issue #18: Auto-Reconnect on Connection Drop — RESOLVED (2026-04-21 archived)

Gateway uses health monitoring + exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max)
in `rns_bridge.py`. All persistent connections should have health monitoring.
Release connection manager resources on disconnect.

### Status
Behavioral pattern; no regression guards required. Still the correct pattern for any
new persistent connection code — verify by reading the existing health-monitor in
`rns_bridge.py` before writing new reconnect logic.


---

## Issue #19: RNS Node Discovery from path_table — RESOLVED (2026-04-21 archived)

Use `RNS.Transport.path_table` (not just `destinations`) for complete routing info.
**path_table may be empty immediately after connect** — use delayed checks (5s) and
periodic re-checks (30s).

Location: `src/gateway/node_tracker.py`

### Status
Stable implementation detail since 2026-02. Retain pattern if rewriting node
discovery — don't re-introduce the `destinations`-only shortcut.


---

## Issue #20: Service Detection & Status Display — RESOLVED (2026-04-21 archived)

All 3 components resolved:

1. **Service Detection**: Simplified to systemctl-only for systemd services (SSOT)
2. **Status Display**: Separates "service state" from "detection capability" —
   never shows "FAILED" when service is running
3. **RX Messages**: `event_bus.py` → `websocket_server.py` → TUI live feed

### RNS Socket Detection
RNS uses abstract Unix domain sockets (`\0rns/{instance_name}`), not UDP port 37428.
Use `check_rns_shared_instance()` (3-tier: Unix socket → TCP → UDP fallback).

### Prevention (automated)
- Lint `MF008` — no raw `systemctl is-active` for service state (use `check_service()`).
- `TestServiceCheckContract` — regression guard against raw `systemctl` state checks.
- `TestKnownServicesConsistency` — keeps `KNOWN_SERVICES` correct.
- `TestEventBusThreadPool` — event-bus emission contract stable.
- UI-layer rule still in force: always distinguish "service state" from "detection
  capability" in any new status display code.


---

## Issue #16: Gateway Message Routing Reliability — RESOLVED (2026-04-21 archived)

Delivery is **best-effort** — inherent to mesh networking. Message queue persists
to SQLite for retry. UI always shows "Sent (delivery not guaranteed)" or "Queued".

Files: `commands/messaging.py`, `gateway/rns_bridge.py`, `gateway/message_queue.py`

### Status
Behavioral pattern, stable since early gateway bring-up. Retain UI wording and
SQLite retry path in any new messaging flow — don't show "Delivered" for
best-effort mesh transports.


---

## Issue #24: Python Environment Mismatch (rnsd + meshtastic module) — ARCHIVED (2026-04-21)

rnsd's `Meshtastic_Interface.py` plugin requires the `meshtastic` Python module.
pipx isolation, different Python versions, or user-vs-system site-packages can
make the module invisible to rnsd.

**Fix**: `sudo pip3 install --break-system-packages --ignore-installed meshtastic`
or install into the interpreter rnsd uses: `head -1 $(which rnsd)` then use that
interpreter's pip.

**Diagnose**: `sudo python3 -c "import meshtastic; print(meshtastic.__version__)"`

### Status
Upstream-driven; stable since initial bring-up. Still a relevant footgun for
fresh Pi installs — the plugin itself is disabled on the fleet per Issue #36.


---

## Issue #27: rnsd is OPTIONAL — ARCHIVED (2026-04-21)

MeshForge supports two independent transports:
- **MQTT** (mosquitto) — Meshtastic native. Used for preset bridging, monitoring.
- **RNS** (rnsd) — Reticulum. Used for LXMF messaging, cross-protocol bridging.

**Meshtastic preset bridging** (LF ↔ ST) needs only mosquitto — both radios MQTT
uplink/downlink to the same broker with same channel/PSK. No gateway code needed.

**Full NOC** (Meshtastic + RNS) uses both transports. They coexist independently.

### Status
Design principle, stable. When scoping a deployment, check whether RNS is
actually required — many preset-bridging use cases don't need it.


---

## Issue #36: Meshtastic_Interface rnsd plugin — keep disabled (2026-04-20, archived 2026-04-21)

**Decision**: the rnsd `Meshtastic_Interface.py` plugin is installed
(`/etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py.disabled`) but NOT loaded.
MeshForge's gateway owns the text-bridging contract.

**Why disabled**: if enabled, the plugin forwards only packets with
`decoded.portnum == RETICULUM_TUNNEL_APP` (native RNS-over-Meshtastic tunneling),
which would bypass `gateway/message_routing.py`, the `gateway.log` audit trail,
the SQLite retry queue, LXMF source identity aggregation, and all plain-text
Meshtastic support.

**Coexistence**: no port conflict with the current `mqtt_bridge` gateway (which
uses MQTT for RX and HTTP `/api/v1/toradio` for TX, never holding `:4403`). The
plugin could be enabled alongside without fighting for the TCP slot.

**If a future use case needs it** (e.g. native RNS peers communicating over
LoRa without any MQTT broker):
```
sudo mv /etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py.disabled \
        /etc/reticulum/interfaces/Meshtastic_Interface.py
sudo systemctl restart rnsd
sudo journalctl -u rnsd -n 50   # expect "Meshtastic: Opening tcp device..."
```
Requires `python3 -c 'import meshtastic'` from rnsd's interpreter (Issue #24).

### Status
Stable decision; do not re-enable casually. The plugin is complementary
infrastructure, not a gateway replacement.
