# TDD Feature Implementation

What feature would you like me to implement using TDD?

**Please describe feature X:**

---

Once you specify the feature, I will:

1. **Write failing tests** - Create test cases that define expected behavior
2. **Implement feature** - Write minimum code to pass tests
3. **Run tests** - Execute test suite
4. **Debug and fix** - If any tests fail, investigate and fix
5. **Refactor** - Clean up code while keeping tests green
6. **Repeat** - Continue until all tests pass

When complete, I will output: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
