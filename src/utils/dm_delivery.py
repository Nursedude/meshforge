"""Classify Meshtastic DM delivery from a sender's own API session.

The rule, measured live on 2026-10-03 (one fleet box, 10 want_ack DMs) and read
in firmware v2.7.26:

* DELIVERED only when a positive ROUTING_APP ack carrying the DM's packet id
  comes FROM the DM's destination. Our own radio emits a positive ack too —
  one arrived ~20 ms after EVERY send, before any relay could repeat it — and
  again on overhearing a relay (ReliableRouter.cpp:54) or an MQTT echo
  (MQTT.cpp:97). Those prove the DM LEFT, not that it ARRIVED.
* FAILED on any NAK: only our radio (MAX_RETRANSMIT) or the destination ever
  sends one (NextHopRouter.cpp:281-284, isFromUs guard).
* LEFT_ONLY when the only positive acks came from someone else.
* NO_WITNESS when nothing came back in the listening window — unknown, never
  counted as a failure reason of its own.

The journal cannot be the witness (every ack line is LOG_DEBUG; the fleet
logs at info) and meshtasticd's JSONFile cannot either (its serializer
writes no request_id for routing packets). The sender's own API session
sees request_id + sender for each ack, so it is the witness.

Pure functions; no I/O. The sending half is scripts/dm_delivery_check.py.
